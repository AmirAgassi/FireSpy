# FireSpy
FireSpy allows for monitoring RemoteEvents, along with editing, blocking, or firing custom RemoteEvents to exploit filtering-enabled games on Roblox.

FireSpy runs on Roblox's internal Lua C functions on a custom lua_state. Simple Lua C functions are exceptionally easy to fix once Roblox patches the exploit, preserving it's longevity and basically ensuring my time isn't wasted.
